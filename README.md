# Buy-Sell_Website_SFSU
Website development project, created as a part of the B.S. Computer Science program at San Francisco State University. The purpose of the project was to design a website intended for SFSU students to post items for sale, while giving other SFSU students the ability to purchase them. 

The files displayed in this repository are for showcasing purposes, and therefore only encompass a very small part of the complete project. 

The project was created in a team of 6 students, using Git and Github to work remotely the majority of the semester. Netbeans and the CodeIgniter web framework was used to commit files to the project. 
The website is not currently live, since it had to be taken down due to security reasons, but a short video demonstration can be seen here: https://youtu.be/hGNtEvhVRZE
